Question One: What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

    Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development 
    and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and 
    maintenance of software products. while traditional programming refers to the process of writing down specific sets of 
    instructions for a computer to execute. According to Anto Semeraro "Programming can be seen as a subset of software 
    engineering, a craft focused on the art of writing code, and the primary concern is to have all the code functions as 
    intended, solving specific problems, or performing certain operations. On the other hand, software engineering 
    encompasses a broader spectrum, which includes not only the act of writing code but also the 
    structured process of developing, maintaining, and managing software projects."

Question Two: Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

    The software development life cycle(SDLC) is a model that guides software engineering teams on how to efficiently and 
    effectively design and build high-quality softwares. 
    It has six stages which are:
    The requirement phase where the teams gather and document user needs and system requirements.

    The Design Phase where the teams create a high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

    The Implementation phase which is where the programmers step in to write codes and build the software
     according to desing specifications.   

    The testing phase where various tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functions. 

    The deployment phase is the stage where the software is released to users or customers.

    The maintenance phase is the stage where ongoing support is provided, together with updates and enhancements to the 
    software after deployment.

Question Three: Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. 
What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

    Software development models are various processes or methods that are chosen for project development depending on the objectives and goals 
    of the project. Agile and Waterfall are some of the models of software development. Others include scrum, spiral, prototype, incremental, e.t.c.
    
    The Waterfall model
    The waterfall model is linear and sequential, which means that a development phase cannot begin until the previous phase is completed.
    i.e the development phases will never overlap. Using the SDLC as an example, in an organization, this means that the project will first pass
    through the requirement phase. After the phase is completed and finalized, The project is moved to the second phase which is the desgin phase.
    After everything has been approved and finalized, the project proceeds to the Implementation stage. It carries on this way, until it gets to
    the final stage which is the maintenance stage.

    The Agile model
    The agile model is an exact opposit of the waterfall stage. it is a type of software development methodology that anticipates the need 
    for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism to the delivery of the finished product. It also emphasizes the importance of team 
    collaboration and delivering a working product quickly to meet customer needs and expectations. 

    The key differences between the two models is that one adopts a linear top to bottom approach, while the other adopts an iterative approach
    to software development. Another key difference is that the waterfall model is most convenient for short term projects, while the agile
    model is more convenient for long term projects. 

Question Four: What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
    Requirements engineering (RE) refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. Requirement engineering provides the appropriate mechanism to understand what the customer desires, analyzing the need, and assessing feasibility, negotiating a reasonable solution,
    specifying the solution clearly, validating the specifications and managing the requirements as they are transformed into a working system.
    This process ensures that the software product aligns with the needs and expectations of stakeholders, including users, customers, 
    and regulatory bodies.
    It offers an effective platform for identifying the wishes of the client by evaluating their requirements, determining its viability, discussing 
    and defining a fair solution, verifying the criteria, and handling requirements as they are converted into a working system.

                    importance of Requirement engineering in SDLC

                    1. Requirement engineering provides a clear and detailed understanding of what needs to be built, 
                       serving as the foundation for all subsequent development activities. It guides the design, implementation, and testing phases.

                    2. By ensuring that requirements are complete, clear, and validated, requirement engineering helps in producing a 
                       higher-quality software product that meets user needs and expectations.

                    3. Identifying and addressing potential issues and misunderstandings early in the project reduces the risk 
                       of costly errors and rework later in the SDLC. It helps in managing project risks effectively.

                    4. Documenting requirements in a structured and standardized way ensures that all stakeholders, including 
                       developers, testers, and business analysts, have a common understanding. This facilitates better communication and collaboration.

                    5. Requirement engineering helps in identifying and documenting regulatory and compliance requirements, 
                       ensuring that the software meets all necessary legal and regulatory standards.

                    6. Requirement engineering ensures that the final software product aligns with the
                       users' needs and expectations, leading to higher customer satisfaction and a better user experience.


Question Five: Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
    Modularity in software engineering means breaking complex software systems down into smaller manageable modules or components that are 
    tightly coupled together. With the aim to simplify by modularizing the program into units or reusable building blocks that can be easily 
    exchanged for one another. By splitting one large complex system into several small, workable modules, software developers can boost the 
    development progress, encourage collaboration between teams, and build strong, adaptive software. 
    Modularity will remain a cornerstone of efficient software engineering as it enables designing and maintaining 
    software that meets ever-changing user and business needs.

    Modularity in software design improves maintainability by allowing individual modules to be tested, debugged, and updated independently, 
    simplifying the management of the system. It enhances scalability by enabling different modules to be scaled independently 
    based on their specific needs. This approach also supports parallel development, allowing teams to work on different modules simultaneously, accelerating overall progress. Additionally, modularity ensures issues in one part 
    of the system are contained, preventing them from affecting other components and thus maintaining system stability during scaling efforts.

Question Six: Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
Why is testing crucial in software development?
    Software testing is an activity performed to identify errors so that errors can be removed to obtain a product with greater quality.
    There are different levels of testing 
        1. Unit testing: In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the 
           components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software.

        2. Integration testing: In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting
           components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and
           interface errors are also detected.

        3. System testing: In system testing, complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements 
           forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.

        4. Acceptance testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its 
           delivery and that the software works correctly in the userâ€™s working environment.

    Testing is crucial in software development because it ensures that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.
    It helps identify and fix bugs and defects early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort needed for corrections later on. 
    By verifying the software's functionality, testing improves the overall quality and reliability of the product and ensures that the software
    is secure, protecting against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious users.

Question Seven: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? 
Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
    Version control systems are software that help track changes make in code over time. As a developer edits code, 
    the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed.

    Version control systems are important because they enable multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously, tracking 
    changes and preventing conflicts. They maintain a complete history of all changes made to the code, allowing developers to revert to 
    previous versions if necessary. Version control systems facilitate branching and merging, enabling developers to work on new features or 
    bug fixes without disrupting the main codebase. They provide accountability and transparency by recording who made specific changes and why. 
    Version control systems also enhances project management by allowing for better organization and tracking of different development stages. 
    Ultimately, they ensure the stability and integrity of the software, making development more efficient and reliable.

Question Eight: Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software 
projects?
