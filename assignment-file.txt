Question One: What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

    Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development 
    and maintenance of high quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and 
    maintenance of software products. while traditional programming refers to the process of writing down specific sets of 
    instructions for a computer to execute. According to Anto Semeraro "Programming can be seen as a subset of software 
    engineering, a craft focused on the art of writing code, and the primary concern is to have all the code functions as 
    intended, solving specific problems, or performing certain operations. On the other hand, software engineering 
    encompasses a broader spectrum, which includes not only the act of writing code but also the 
    structured process of developing, maintaining, and managing software projects."

Question Two: Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

    The software development life cycle(SDLC) is a model that guides software engineering teams on how to efficiently and 
    effectively design and build high-quality softwares. 
    It has six stages which are:
    The requirement phase where the teams gather and document user needs and system requirements.

    The Design Phase where the teams create a high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

    The Implementation phase which is where the programmers step in to write codes and build the software
     according to desing specifications.   

    The testing phase where various tests are conducted to ensure the software meets quality standards and functions. 

    The deployment phase is the stage where the software is released to users or customers.

    The maintenance phase is the stage where ongoing support is provided, together with updates and enhancements to the 
    software after deployment.
